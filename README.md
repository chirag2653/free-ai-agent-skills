## 🚀 Quick Start

**Simple 3-step process:**

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chirag2653/free-ai-agent-skills.git
   ```

2. **Install the skill to your AI agent's directory:**
   - **Cursor**: `~/.cursor/skills/` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\skills\` on Windows)
   - **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/skills/`
   - **Codex**: `~/.codex/skills/`
   - **Other agents**: Check your agent's documentation for the skills directory

   Copy or symlink the skill folder there.

3. **That's it!** Your AI agent will automatically detect and use the skill.

### The Real Power

Add your API keys to your project's `.env.local` file:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Now any AI agent working in your project folder can generate images directly - no separate configuration needed!

## 📖 How Skills Work

Skills use the universal **SKILL.md standard** - a simple format that any AI agent can understand:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Instructions for AI agents (frontmatter + markdown)
└── scripts/           # Executable scripts (if needed)
```

**The Magic:**
1. **Project-Aware**: Skills read API keys and config from your project's `.env` files
2. **Agent-Agnostic**: Works with any AI agent that supports skills (coding, marketing, design, writing agents)
3. **Zero Configuration**: Agent auto-detects skills, pulls credentials from your project
4. **Universal Format**: One skill works across Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more

**Example Use Cases:**
- 🖥️ **Coding agent** generates UI mockups in your app's `public/images/` folder
- 📱 **Marketing agent** creates social media graphics with your brand assets
- 📝 **Writing agent** generates illustrations for blog posts in your content folder
- 🎨 **Design agent** prototypes icons and banners using project style guides
